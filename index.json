Mocks are used to replace dependencies, while spies are used to wrap around real objects. The main difference between mocks and spies is that mocks are used to isolate the code under test from its dependencies, while spies are used to test real objects in isolation while allowing us to verify their behavior. Code examples are provided to illustrate the usage and differences of mocks and spies.","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Mockito Explained: How to Choose Between Mocks and Spies for Effective Unit Testing","uri":"/2023/04/25/How-to-Choose-Between-Mocks-and-Spies/"},{"description":"How to use Mockito with PowerMock to test final and static methods in Java.
