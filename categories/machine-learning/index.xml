        <description>So far in the series we have learned about forms on regression models. Each of those models was used to solve a target variable that was a linear number.
Now we enter a territory where target variables might not be that straight forward. The target variables would be in the form binary, category, etc. Basically anything other than a number. Ex - Cat vs Dog, Yes or No, Reg, Green or Blue.</description>

        <description>In the previous post, we learnt about Support vector regression. In this post, we will see a new way of deciphering information using a simple format of traversing conditions.
Business Goal: Can you spot the king? The people of Falkland are scared. Their king disguises as a common man and roams among them to gain knowledge about his kingdom and see if his policies are working in his kingdom. When the king is disguised, the common people don&amp;rsquo;t recognize him.</description>

        <description>In the previous post, we learnt about multiple linear regression. The problem with the last approach was that we used all the features without considering that some of the features may not be impacting or playing any role in the outcome. we also talked about 5 ways of reducing the noisy feature. Backward elimination is one of them.

        <description>In the previous post, we learnt about a P-Value, a prerequisite for learning Multiple Linear Regression.
Business Problem: In this series, we will take a look at a dataset of 50 startup companies.
A venture capitalist has hired you as a data scientist and wants you to help him select which type of company he should invest so that he can make the most profit. You need to review spending on R&amp;amp;D, Admin cost, marketing cost and location to make the decision</description>

        <description>In the previous post, we learnt about Simple Linear regression. I wanted to start this section with multiple linear regression tutorial but as I was going over the content on the template to run create the regression model, I felt that we need understand P-Value concept before we move ahead.
So what is P-Value ?
Before I bore you with stats definition of the P-Value. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with something simple.</description>

        <description>In the previous post we learned about data pre-processing. In this post we will review the simplest algorithm - Simple Linear Regression.
Business Problem: In this series, we are going to learn about Simple Linear Regression. We will review a data set about Salary and Experience in age. As a data scientist, your job is to help the HR department predict the salary of a person based on his years of experience if he or she accepts the job offer.</description>
